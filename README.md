> **Pre-v1.0 Beta** — Cognithor is under active development. APIs may change between releases. Not recommended for production customer-facing deployments. Bug reports and feedback welcome via [Issues](../../issues).
>
> While the test suite is extensive (13,000+ tests, 89% coverage), the project has not been battle-tested in production environments. Expect rough edges, breaking changes between versions, and some German-language strings in system prompts and error messages. See [Status & Maturity](#status--maturity) for details. For non-technical users, wait until version 1.0.0 for stable long-term support.

> **Vibe-Engineered, not vibe-coded.** Cognithor is not a weekend hack held together by AI-generated spaghetti. Every module follows a deliberate architecture (PGE-Trinity, 6-phase gateway init, 3-layer security), backed by 13,000+ tests, structured plans, spec compliance reviews, and code quality gates. The AI writes the code — but a human engineers the system. There's a difference.

## Why Cognithor?

Most AI assistants send your data to the cloud. Cognithor runs entirely on your machine — with Ollama or LM Studio, no API keys required. Cloud providers are optional, not mandatory.

It replaces a patchwork of tools with one integrated system: 18 channels, 145+ MCP tools, 6-tier memory with 4-channel hybrid search, knowledge vault, voice, browser automation, Computer Use, cross-platform social listening, and more — all wired together from day one. 13,000+ tests at 89% coverage keep it honest. See [Status & Maturity](#status--maturity) for what that does and does not guarantee.

**In plain terms:** Cognithor is an AI assistant that lives entirely on your computer. You talk to it through your terminal, a web UI, Telegram, Discord, or any of 18 supported channels — and it talks back, remembers what you said last week, and acts on your behalf. It can search the web, write and edit files, run shell commands, control your browser, automate your desktop (clicking, typing, reading windows), manage your calendar, and learn new skills over time. Think of it as a local, private, self-improving Jarvis.

Unlike cloud-based assistants, Cognithor keeps all your data on your machine. Your conversations, memories, documents, and credentials never leave your hardware unless you explicitly configure a cloud LLM provider. It works fully offline with Ollama or LM Studio, and it encrypts everything at rest with SQLCipher (AES-256). If privacy matters to you — and it should — this is the architecture you want.

What makes it different from other local AI tools is that Cognithor is not just a chatbot. It is an agent operating system: it plans multi-step tasks, evaluates its own results, learns from mistakes, and improves autonomously. It can control your desktop through Computer Use (screenshots, clicks, keystrokes, window automation), compete in ARC-AGI-3 reasoning benchmarks, and manage a marketplace of community-contributed skills. It is built to grow with you.

### PGE Trinity (Planner -> Gatekeeper -> Executor)

Every user request passes through three stages:

1. **Planner** — LLM-based understanding and planning. Analyzes the request, searches memory for relevant context, creates structured action plans with tool calls. Supports re-planning on failures.
2. **Gatekeeper** — Deterministic policy engine. Validates every planned tool call against security rules (risk levels GREEN/YELLOW/ORANGE/RED, sandbox policy, parameter validation). No LLM, no hallucinations, no exceptions.
3. **Executor** — Executes approved actions via DAG-based parallel scheduling (independent actions run concurrently in waves). Shell commands run isolated (Process -> Namespace -> Container), file access restricted to allowed paths.

### 6-Tier Cognitive Memory

| Tier | Name | Persistence | Purpose |
|------|------|------------|---------|
| 1 | **Core** | `CORE.md` | Identity, rules, personality |
| 2 | **Episodic** | Daily log files | What happened today/yesterday |
| 3 | **Semantic** | Knowledge graph + SQLite | Customers, products, facts, relations |
| 4 | **Procedural** | Markdown + frontmatter | Learned skills and workflows |
| 5 | **Working** | RAM (volatile) | Active session context |
| 6 | **Tactical** | SQLite | Active goals, pending actions, rollback |

Memory search uses a 4-channel hybrid approach: **BM25** (full-text search with FTS5, optimized for German compound words) + **Vector Search** (Ollama embeddings, cosine similarity) + **Graph Traversal** (entity relations) + **Hierarchical Document Reasoning** (tree-based section navigation for long documents). Score fusion with configurable weights and recency decay.

### Knowledge Vault

In addition to the 6-tier memory, Cognithor includes an **Obsidian-compatible Knowledge Vault** (`~/.cognithor/vault/`) for persistent, human-readable notes:

- **Folder structure**: `recherchen/`, `meetings/`, `wissen/`, `projekte/`, `daily/`
- **Obsidian format**: YAML frontmatter (title, tags, sources, dates), `[[backlinks]]`
- **6 tools**: `vault_save`, `vault_search`, `vault_list`, `vault_read`, `vault_update`, `vault_link`
- Open the vault folder directly in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) for graph visualization

### Reflection & Procedural Learning

After completed sessions, the Reflector evaluates results, extracts facts for semantic memory, and identifies repeatable patterns as procedure candidates. Learned procedures are automatically suggested for future similar requests.

### Computer Use Pipeline

```
User Goal → CUTaskDecomposer → Sub-Tasks
  → UIA (exact coords) / Vision (fallback)
  → 3-Layer Tool Enforcement
  → Adaptive Wait → Next Iteration
```

Cognithor can control your desktop like a human: take screenshots, analyze them with a vision model, click at pixel coordinates, type text, scroll, and drag. Phase 3 adds Windows UI Automation via pywinauto, which reads the OS accessibility tree to get exact element coordinates without relying on vision alone. A 3-layer security model (allowlist + gatekeeper + tool enforcer) ensures destructive operations require explicit approval.

## LLM Providers

Cognithor auto-detects your backend from API keys. Set one key and models are configured automatically:

| Provider | Backend Type | Config Key | Models (Planner / Executor) |

## Demo

```bash
python demo.py           # Full experience (~3 minutes)
python demo.py --fast    # Speed run (~15 seconds)
```

## Quick Start

**Under 5 minutes from download to running agent.**

### Option A: Windows Installer (recommended for Windows users)

1. **Download** `CognithorSetup-{version}.exe` from the [latest release](https://github.com/Alex8791-cyber/cognithor/releases/latest)
2. **Run the installer** — it bundles Python, Ollama, Flutter UI, and all dependencies
3. **Launch** via Desktop shortcut or Start Menu
4. **Done** — browser opens at `http://localhost:8741`

> The installer auto-detects your GPU, downloads the right models, and runs a health check. No prerequisites needed.

### Option B: Linux / macOS / Source Install

```bash
# Clone
git clone https://github.com/Alex8791-cyber/cognithor.git
cd cognithor

# Linux/macOS: Interactive installer (venv, Ollama, models, systemd)
chmod +x install.sh && ./install.sh

# Windows (from source): Double-click install.bat

# Or manual: pip install
pip install -e ".[all,dev]"
```

### Option C: PyPI (any platform)

```bash
pip install cognithor               # Core only: PGE, CLI, Ollama
pip install cognithor[telegram]     # + Telegram channel
pip install cognithor[web]          # + Web UI (Flutter Command Center)
pip install cognithor[all]          # Everything (large install)
ollama pull qwen3:8b                # Pull a model
cognithor                           # Start

# Upgrade to a specific version:
pip install cognithor[all]==0.92.2

# Upgrade to latest:
pip install --upgrade cognithor[all]
```

### Prerequisites (Option B/C only)

- Python >= 3.12
- [Ollama](https://ollama.ai) (local, free) **or** any cloud LLM API key (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, etc.)

### After Installation: Pull Models

```bash
ollama pull qwen3:32b              # Planner (20 GB VRAM)
ollama pull qwen3:8b               # Executor (6 GB VRAM)
ollama pull qwen3-embedding:0.6b   # Embeddings (500 MB VRAM)
```

No GPU? Use `qwen3:8b` for both, or set a cloud API key — models are auto-configured.

> **Uninstall:** Windows: run `uninstall.bat`. Linux: `./install.sh --uninstall`. PyPI: `pip uninstall cognithor`.

### Step 2: Pull an LLM (~2 min)

```bash
ollama pull qwen3:32b           # Planner (20 GB VRAM)
ollama pull qwen3:8b            # Executor (6 GB VRAM)
ollama pull qwen3-embedding:0.6b    # Embeddings (500 MB VRAM)
# Optional:
ollama pull qwen3-coder:30b     # Code tasks (20 GB VRAM)
```

No GPU? Use smaller models (`qwen3:8b` for both) or a cloud provider — just set one API key.

### Step 3: Start (~10 sec)

**Option A: One-Click (Windows)** — includes a pre-built Web UI, no Node.js needed

```
Double-click  start_cognithor.bat  ->  Browser opens  ->  Click "Power On"  ->  Done.
```

> The launcher auto-installs Python and Ollama via winget if missing. Node.js is only needed for UI development (`npm run dev`).

**Option B: CLI**

```bash
cognithor                          # Interactive CLI
python -m cognithor                   # Same thing (always works, no PATH needed)

python -m cognithor --lite            # Lite mode: qwen3:8b only (6 GB VRAM)
python -m cognithor --no-cli          # Headless mode (API only)
COGNITHOR_HOME=~/my-cognithor cognithor  # Custom home directory
```

> **Windows:** If `cognithor` is not recognized after `pip install`, use `python -m cognithor` instead — this always works regardless of PATH configuration. Alternatively, add Python's `Scripts` directory to your PATH (typically `%APPDATA%\Python\PythonXY\Scripts` or the `Scripts` folder inside your venv).

**Option C: Flutter Command Center (Development)**

```bash
cd flutter_app
flutter pub get
flutter run       # Desktop, or:
flutter run -d chrome  # Web
```

The Flutter Command Center connects to the Python backend on port 8741. Start the backend first (`python -m cognithor --no-cli`), then launch the Flutter app. The **Chat page** opens as the default start page — start talking to Cognithor immediately, or activate **Voice Mode** for hands-free conversation. The Sci-Fi aesthetic features dark translucent panels, neon accents, and GEPA pipeline visualization.

All configuration — agents, prompts, cron jobs, MCP servers, A2A settings — can be edited and saved through the dashboard. Changes persist to YAML files under `~/.cognithor/`.

> **Legacy React UI (deprecated):** The old React + Vite UI in `ui/` is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Use the Flutter Command Center instead.

> **Windows users:** A desktop shortcut named **Cognithor** is included for convenience.

### Channel Auto-Detection

Channels start automatically when their tokens are found in `~/.cognithor/.env`:

```bash
# ~/.cognithor/.env — just add your tokens, channels activate automatically
COGNITHOR_TELEGRAM_TOKEN=your-bot-token
COGNITHOR_TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USERS=123456789
COGNITHOR_DISCORD_TOKEN=your-discord-token
COGNITHOR_SLACK_TOKEN=xoxb-your-slack-token
```

No need to set `telegram_enabled: true` in the config — the presence of the token is sufficient.

| **File-Size Limits** | Upload/processing limits on all paths: 50 MB documents, 100 MB audio, 1 MB code execution, 50 MB WebUI uploads |
| **Session Persistence** | Channel-to-session mappings stored in SQLite (WAL mode). Survives restarts — no lost Telegram/Discord sessions |
| **Input Sanitization** | Injection protection for shell commands and file paths |
| **Sub-Agent Depth Guard** | Configurable `max_sub_agent_depth` (default 3) prevents infinite handle_message() recursion |
| **SSRF Protection** | Private IP blocking for http_request and web_fetch tools |
| **EU AI Act** | Compliance module, impact assessments, transparency reports |
| **Red-Teaming** | Automated offensive security tests (1,425 LOC) |

### GDPR Compliance (Privacy by Design) — 100% User Rights

Cognithor implements GDPR compliance at the architecture level with full coverage of all user rights:

- **Consent Management** — Per-channel consent with versioning. No data processing without explicit consent.
- **ComplianceEngine** — Runtime enforcement gate. Fail-closed design: blocks processing if consent store unavailable.
- **Art. 15 (Access)** — Complete export across 11 data tiers (sessions, vault, entities, relations, episodes, procedures, core memory, preferences, processing logs, model usage, consents). JSON + CSV formats.
- **Art. 16 (Rectification)** — `PATCH /api/v1/user/data` for entities, preferences, vault notes.
- **Art. 17 (Erasure)** — `DELETE /api/v1/user/data` with 7 erasure handlers covering all data tiers including vault notes.
- **Art. 18/21 (Restriction)** — Per-purpose restriction (evolution, cloud_llm, memory, osint) via REST API + ComplianceEngine enforcement.
- **Art. 20 (Portability)** — Export format v2.0 `cognithor_portable` + `POST /api/v1/user/data/import`.
- **Encryption at Rest** — SQLCipher (AES-256) for all 33 SQLite databases, Fernet for memory files, OS Keyring key management.
- **Audit Trail** — Append-only, SHA-256-chained compliance log with tamper detection.
- **TTL Enforcement** — Automated daily retention enforcement via cron.
- **Privacy Mode** — Runtime toggle disabling all persistent storage.
- **Processing Register** — Art. 30 compliant register of all 13 processing activities.

## Deployment

> **Caution:** Cognithor is Beta software. Test thoroughly in your environment before relying on it for important workflows. Back up your data regularly. See [Status & Maturity](#status--maturity).

### One-Click (Windows)

Double-click `start_cognithor.bat` -> browser opens -> click **Power On** -> done.

### Docker (Development)

```bash
docker compose up -d                         # Core backend
docker compose --profile webui up -d         # + Web UI
```

### Docker (Production)

```bash
cp .env.example .env   # Edit: set COGNITHOR_API_TOKEN, etc.
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d

# With optional services
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml --profile postgres up -d   # + PostgreSQL
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml --profile nginx up -d      # + Nginx TLS
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml --profile monitoring up -d # + Prometheus + Grafana
```

Services: Cognithor (headless) + WebUI + Ollama + optional PostgreSQL (pgvector) + optional Nginx reverse proxy + optional Prometheus/Grafana monitoring. GPU support via nvidia-container-toolkit (uncomment in compose file).

### Bare-Metal Server (Ubuntu/Debian)

```bash
sudo bash deploy/install-server.sh --domain cognithor.example.com --email admin@example.com
# Or with self-signed cert:
sudo bash deploy/install-server.sh --domain test.local --self-signed
```

Installs to `/opt/cognithor/`, data in `/var/lib/cognithor/`, systemd services `cognithor` + `cognithor-webui`.

### Systemd (User-Level)

```bash
./install.sh --systemd
systemctl --user enable --now cognithor
journalctl --user -u cognithor -f    # Logs
```

### Health Checks

```bash
curl http://localhost:8741/api/v1/health     # Command Center API
curl http://localhost:8080/api/v1/health     # WebUI (standalone)
curl http://localhost:9090/metrics           # Prometheus metrics
```

### Backup

```bash
./scripts/backup.sh                    # Create backup
./scripts/backup.sh --list             # List backups
./scripts/backup.sh --restore latest   # Restore
```

See [`deploy/README.md`](deploy/README.md) for full deployment documentation (Docker profiles, TLS, Nginx/Caddy, bare-metal install, monitoring, troubleshooting).

## Language & Internationalization

Cognithor ships with a **JSON-based i18n language pack system** (since v0.33.0). The default language is English, switchable via the Flutter Command Center or `config.yaml`.

### How It Works

```python
from cognithor.i18n import t, set_locale

set_locale("en")  # or "de"
print(t("error.timeout"))  # "The operation timed out..."
```

- **Language packs**: JSON files in `src/cognithor/i18n/locales/` (e.g., `en.json`, `de.json`)
- **Dot-notation keys**: `{"error": {"timeout": "..."}}` → `t("error.timeout")`
- **Fallback chain**: Current locale → English → raw key
- **SHA-256 integrity**: Optional `.sha256` sidecar files for community pack verification
- **Thread-safe**: Locale switching via `set_locale()` is thread-safe

### Switching Language

1. **Flutter Command Center**: General → "Sprache / Language" dropdown, or click the language button in the header
2. **Config file**: Set `language: en` in `~/.cognithor/config.yaml`
3. **Environment variable**: `COGNITHOR_LANGUAGE=en`

| Area | i18n Status | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------|
| **Error messages** | Fully i18n | `utils/error_messages.py` uses `t()` |
| **Tool names** | Fully i18n | All 20 MCP tools have translated names |
| **Personality / Greetings** | Fully i18n | Greetings, empathy, success messages |
| **System prompts** (Planner) | i18n keys | Prompt templates in language packs |
| **Flutter Command Center** | Partial | Config labels still hardcoded (planned) |
| **Log messages** | English only | structlog keys are not translated |

### Contributing Translations

1. Copy `src/cognithor/i18n/locales/en.json` to `<locale>.json` (e.g., `zh.json`, `fr.json`)
2. Translate all ~250 string values
3. Run `python -c "from cognithor.i18n import generate_pack_hash; generate_pack_hash('<locale>')"`
4. Submit a PR

**Metrics:** ~205,000 LOC source · ~168,000 LOC tests · 13,000+ tests · 89% coverage · 0 lint errors · **Status: Beta**

## What's New

### v0.92.7 (2026-04-23)
- **Video input via vLLM** — end-to-end video analysis in chat using Qwen3.6-27B or any vLLM-served VLM. Paperclip → "Video hochladen" or paste a direct `.mp4`/`.webm`/`.mov`/`.mkv`/`.avi` URL. Adaptive frame sampling via `ffprobe` (short clips: `fps=3`, long clips: `num_frames=32`), 500 MB per-file cap + 5 GB quota with LRU eviction, session-lifetime + 24 h TTL cleanup, no silent fallback to Ollama (Ollama has no vision). Windows installer now bundles LGPL ffmpeg + CI verifies the GPL-free build. See [`docs/vllm-user-guide.md`](docs/vllm-user-guide.md).
- **Default vLLM image flipped to `cu130-nightly`** — the tagged `v0.19.1` crashes Qwen3.6-27B-NVFP4 at warmup on SM120 (Blackwell / RTX 50xx). The nightly ships the `FlashInferCutlassNvFp4LinearKernel` fix. Day-1 spike findings at [`docs/superpowers/spikes/2026-04-23-video-input-vllm-spike-findings.md`](docs/superpowers/spikes/2026-04-23-video-input-vllm-spike-findings.md).
- **Orchestrator unified** — `backends_api` and `Gateway` now share a single `VLLMOrchestrator` instance via `app.state`, so `media_url` wired after the media server starts actually reaches the `docker run` command.
- **14,118 Python tests + 31 Flutter tests passing** (+180 new for this release), 0 failures, 0 ruff errors.

### v0.92.2 (2026-04-19)
- **Windows Launcher Hardening** — `Cognithor.exe` (the .NET tray app) no longer vanishes silently on startup. All exceptions in the AppShell constructor are now caught, logged to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Cognithor\launcher-crash.log`, and shown via MessageBox. Previously a missing `python\python.exe` (e.g. AV quarantine) would throw `FileNotFoundException` before `Application.Run()` started the message loop, making the process disappear from Task Manager with no trace.
- **Python Resolution 3-Tier Fallback** — Both `Cognithor.exe` and the installer-generated `cognithor.bat` now resolve Python in this order: (1) bundled `<install>\python\python.exe`, (2) `python`/`py` on PATH, (3) well-known install paths (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Python\Python313|312`, `%ProgramFiles%\Python313|312`, `C:\Python313|312`). Users who installed Python without ticking "Add to PATH" (the default since Python 3.9) are no longer broken.
- **Single-Instance Guard Actually Works** — The process-wide `Mutex` in `Program.cs` is no longer scoped with `using`, which previously disposed it at first return and defeated the guard. Now released explicitly in `finally`.
- **Graceful Python-Missing UX** — `ProcessManager.StartPython` no longer throws when Python is missing. Instead it sets `PythonMissing = true`, and the tray icon shows "Backend not installed" with a balloon tip explaining what's wrong.
- **Square Logos** — `flutter_app/assets/logo.png` and `assets/cognithor_logo.png` were 1536×1024 non-square and got cropped in every UI that used `BoxFit.cover`. Regenerated as 1024×1024 square from `Icon-512.png`. `cognithor_banner.png` rebuilt as 1920×640 dark-theme banner with the logo centered. `cognithor-logo.png` bumped from 52×52 to 192×192 (PWA standard).
- **Flutter web `index.html` branding** — replaced leftover `jarvis_ui` title + apple-touch-title and the default "A new Flutter project." description with real Cognithor branding.
- **Release-workflow idempotency** — explicit release-notes generation replaces `generate_release_notes: true`. The old setup prepended a fresh `**Full Changelog**: ...` line on every workflow re-run; `append_body: false` now guarantees idempotent re-runs.
- **Installer Build Fixes** — `subprocess.run(["flutter",...])` on Windows now resolves via `shutil.which` (flutter is a `.bat`); failed `flutter build windows` (e.g. Developer Mode off) is caught as soft-fail so the rest of the installer still builds; `step_inno_setup` reports the correct version instead of alphabetically-first.
- **Legacy `jarvis_ui.exe` fallback removed** from `ProcessManager.FindDesktopUi` — the only accepted name is `cognithor_ui.exe` (v0.42.0 rename).

### v0.92.1 (2026-04-18)
- **E2E Audit Fixes** — `zh.json` JSON syntax error (unescaped ASCII quotes inside Chinese text, line 458-460) — Chinese locale silently fell back to English until now. Fixed with `「」` corner brackets.
- **Test isolation** — 3× fixture bug in `test_enhanced_integration.py` passed `jarvis_dir=` (unknown field, silently ignored by Pydantic), causing `MemoryManager` to hit the real `~/.cognithor/db/` and fail with "database disk image is malformed". Now uses `jarvis_home=` + all 52 Config classes have `model_config = ConfigDict(extra="forbid")` so unknown kwargs fail loudly.
- **Tool-Risk Decorator** — `@cognithor_tool(risk_level="green"|"yellow"|"orange"|"red")` + `PackManifest.tool_risks` field. PackLoader pushes declared risks into `mcp_client._tool_registry` on load. Previously 15/18 pack tools defaulted to ORANGE (user approval required for read-only scans); now every pack tool gets its declared level.
- **CI Hardening** — new `scripts` job runs `verify_all.py` and `smoke_test.py` so these stop rotting outside CI. New `flutter` job runs `dart analyze` and `flutter test`. Lint job gains full `ruff check` + `ruff format --check`.
- **UTF-8 on Windows** — `PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8` + `PYTHONUTF8=1` added to `start_cognithor.bat` and `install.bat`. `_DEFAULT_CORE_MEMORY` template now ships real umlauts ("Identität") instead of ASCII fallback ("Identitaet").
- **Scripts repaired** — `smoke_test.py` cp1252-crash fixed (box-drawing + checkmark chars → ASCII `[OK]`/`[WARN]`/`[FAIL]`); `live_smoke_test.py` stdout UTF-8 + legacy `jarvis.config` import + `list_models()` API signature; `verify_all.py` completely rewritten for v0.92.x architecture (was checking deleted `cognithor.social` module and stale `src/jarvis/` paths).
- **Flutter ARB parity** — 11 missing keys added to `app_zh.arb` + `app_ar.arb` (connectionLost, actionApproved, errorWithDetail, …).
- **Lint + format green** — 90 ruff errors resolved (74 auto-fix + 16 manual), 17 dart-analyze issues resolved; `ruff format --check` now clean.
- **13,791 tests passing** (+19 new tool-risk tests), 0 failures.

### v0.92.0 (2026-04-16)
- **Agent Pack Architecture** — Full plugin system for paid & free agent packs. `cognithor.packs` module: `PackManifest` (Pydantic v2), `PackLoader` (importlib isolation), `PackInstaller` (zip/URL + EULA click-through), CLI (`cognithor pack install|list|remove|update|accept-eula`). Packs live in `~/.cognithor/packs/` and register at startup.
- **Leads SDK** — `cognithor.leads` replaces the old `cognithor.social` module. Source-agnostic `LeadSource` ABC, `SourceRegistry`, `LeadService` orchestrator, `LeadStore` with `source_id` column. Any pack can register a lead source — Reddit, HN, Discord, RSS, or future custom sources.
- **Reddit Lead Hunter Pro** — First paid Agent Pack (€75 indie / €179 commercial via Lemon Squeezy). Extracted from Core into private `cognithor-packs` repo. Includes: Reddit scanner, 50 reply templates, Playwright auto-poster, style learner, subreddit discovery. Core retains zero Reddit-specific code.
- **3 Free Bundled Packs** — Hacker News Lead Hunter, Discord Lead Hunter, RSS Lead Hunter. Apache 2.0, auto-installed on first Cognithor start. Same pack interface as paid packs.
- **cognithor.ai** — Marketing site deployed on Vercel. Build-time pack catalog fetch from private GitHub repo via Octokit. Auto-rebuild on pack repo push via deploy hook. Pack detail pages with strikethrough pricing, checkout flow, post-purchase install command page.
- **Flutter Pack-Aware UI** — `PackPreviewOverlay` shows real pack UI greyed out with unlock CTA. `LockedPackCard` for free packs. `SourcesProvider` polls `/api/v1/leads/sources`. Leads tab gated on registered sources. Settings → Social shows Reddit config disabled with "Get this Pack" overlay when pack not installed.
- **Anti-Enshittification Promise** — `/promise` page: Core stays free forever, packs add but never subtract, zero telemetry. "This isn't marketing copy. It's a contract. If we ever break it, fork the repo."
- **EULA System** — Every pack ships `eula.md` with SHA-256 pinned in manifest. Installer prompts click-through, persists acceptance. Loader rejects packs with hash mismatch or missing acceptance.
- **`src/cognithor/social/` DELETED** — 15 Python files (~4000 LOC) extracted to agent packs. Gateway rewritten for source-agnostic `LeadService`. No backward compatibility shim remains.
- **13,600+ tests passing** across Core + packs + site (657 vitest)

### v0.91.0 (2026-04-14)
- **Unified Leads Engine** — Generalized the Reddit-only lead system into a multi-source engine (#113). RSS/Atom feed scanner (stdlib `xml.etree`, no new deps), configurable per-source in Flutter Settings → Social. Sidebar Leads tab gated on `leads_engine_enabled` — hidden when all sources disabled.
- **Installer Language Fix** — Inno Setup language choice now persists to Cognithor config (#114). `install_language.txt` marker from installer → `bootstrap_windows.py` reads before OS-locale fallback. `first_run.py` skips the language question when marker present.
- **OLLAMA_HOST Normalization** — `OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0` no longer crashes httpx (#115). `_normalize_ollama_url()` helper accepts bare hosts, host:port, full URLs. Wired as `default_factory` + `before` validator on `OllamaConfig.base_url`.
- **13,500+ tests passing**

### v0.90.0 (2026-04-11)
- **Cross-Platform Social Listening** — Hacker News (Firebase + Algolia API, zero auth) + Discord (REST API v10, bot token) scanners join Reddit. Unified `social_scan` and `social_leads` MCP tools. Per-platform config: intervals, min scores, categories/channels. Flutter config UI with HN + Discord sections.
- **Hierarchical Document Reasoning** — 4th retrieval channel: tree-based section navigation for PDF, DOCX, HTML, Markdown, plaintext. `TreeBuilder` + `NodeSelector` (LLM-navigated) + `TreeStore` (SQLite). No embeddings required — structural understanding through heading hierarchy.
- **CAG Layer (Cache-Augmented Generation)** — Deterministic prefix generation for LLM KV-cache reuse. `PrefixBuilder` (Ollama-compatible) + `NativeLlamaCppBuilder`, `ContentNormalizer`, `CacheStore`, hit-rate metrics. Hooks into Planner for automatic prefix injection.
- **CLI Config TUI** — Interactive terminal config editor via `cognithor --config-tui`. Dynamic model discovery from live LLM providers, section navigation, validation, rich formatting.
- **AST-Based Security** — Python `ast.NodeVisitor` guard (40 tests) + `bashlex` shell parser (48 tests) replace regex-based code analysis. Detects dangerous imports, subprocess calls, eval, network access at syntax tree level.
- **`_safe_call()` Pattern** — Unified error handling replacing 79 silent `except Exception: pass` across codebase. Per-function failure registry, async variant, structured logging.
- **Package Rename** — `jarvis` → `cognithor` across 1,265 files (5,770 replacements). Both `cognithor` and `jarvis` entry points preserved for compatibility.
- **Installer Overhaul** — `install.bat` + `install.sh` rewritten with GPU detection, model auto-pull, health checks, auto-upgrade system syncing source tree to installed version on every launch.
- **13,000+ tests passing** across Python 3.12/3.13 x Ubuntu/Windows

### v0.84.0 (2026-04-09)
- **Reddit Lead Hunter** — Full social listening system: scans Reddit for high-intent posts, scores them 0-100 via LLM, drafts context-aware replies. 3 trigger paths (Chat, Cron, REST API). No Reddit API key needed.
- **Reddit Leads Flutter Tab** — 7th navigation tab with filterable lead pipeline, score badges, reply editor, Scan Now FAB. LeadDetailSheet with edit/post/copy/archive actions.
- **Robot Office Live Wiring** — Dynamic robots from real agents, real-time PGE state sync via WebSocket, system metrics driving server rack LEDs, kanban board with real task dots + hover tooltips.
- **Deep Learning Upload Pipeline** — Hybrid: immediate chunk-indexing + background KnowledgeBuilder pipeline (Vault, entities, identity memory). Priority queue, PDF vision, OCR fallback, YouTube frames.
- **20+ Bug Fixes** — Issues #62-#89 resolved: duplicate UI pages removed, i18n gaps filled, audit verify crash, incognito flag, translate prompts, QR pairing, operation mode description, logo fallback, and more.
- **Flutter Auto-Rebuild** — Bootstrap detects outdated builds, auto-rebuilds or downloads pre-built UI from release.

### What's New in v0.74.0

**ARC-AGI-3: 13/25 Games Solved (24 Levels) — SmartExplorer Breakthrough**

Inspired by the [3rd-place ARC-AGI-3 Preview solution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24156), the new SmartExplorer uses systematic state-action graph exploration to solve 7 previously unsolvable games in a single session.

- **SmartExplorer** (`smart_explorer.py`): Tracks tested/untested actions per state, navigates to nearest frontier via BFS on known transitions, prunes no-effect actions, detects click targets via connected components. No ML — pure graph search with smart prioritization
- **7 new games solved**: TR87 (block-matching, 90 steps), BP35 (platformer, 32 steps), CD82 (5 steps), TU93 (18 steps), KA59 (184s), SU15 (122s), TN36 (131s)
- **Key insight**: systematic action testing at every state + frontier navigation >> blind DFS. The SmartExplorer tests every action at every reachable state and navigates back to states with untested actions via shortest known path
- **VisionAgent** (`vision_agent.py`): Prototype for qwen3-vl guided step-by-step gameplay
- **Action 7 fix**: Was completely dropped from keyboard solver filter — now included
- **Clicks as DFS actions**: Click positions are regular DFS branches, enabling multi-click sequences
- **Incremental click-DFS**: For deep click puzzles (LP85 L2), steps forward with env.step instead of replaying
- **Click path shortening**: Removes redundant clicks from solutions
- **Full benchmark**: All 25 games tested: FT09(10), VC33(2), LP85(2), SP80(1), CN04(1), M0R0(1), TR87(1), BP35(1), CD82(1), TU93(1), KA59(1), SU15(1), TN36(1)

### What's New in v0.73.0

**ARC-AGI-3: 7/25 Games Solved — ClickSequenceSolver + KeyboardSolver** — Three solver families covering click, keyboard, and mixed game types.

- **ClickSequenceSolver**: BFS + Simulation A* for water-routing puzzles (VC33: 3/7 levels)
- **KeyboardSolver**: Incremental DFS ~50x faster than replay-based BFS
- **Path shortening**, false positive detection, pump-then-trigger architecture

### What's New in v0.72.0

**ARC-AGI-3: GameAnalyzer + Smart Solver** — Fully automated game analysis and solving pipeline for click-based ARC-AGI-3 games.

- **GameAnalyzer** (`game_analyzer.py`): Sacrifices one level to learn game mechanics, 2 vision calls (qwen3-vl:32b) for strategy guidance, persistent GameProfile cache
- **PerGameSolver** (`per_game_solver.py`): Budget-based strategy mix, smart elimination search with poison-cluster removal
- **760x faster combo testing**: `env.reset()` (0.5ms) replaces `arcade.make()` (380ms)
- **FT09: 10/10 levels solved** (reproducible, ~1s per level after analysis)
- **Toggle-pair detection**: Automatically identifies clickable colors from sacrifice level data

### What's New in v0.71.0

**Computer Use: Complete Desktop Automation Pipeline**
- Phase 2C: Sub-task decomposition with content bags and file creation
- Phase 2D: 3-layer security (allowlist + gatekeeper), coordinate scaling, adaptive wait, prompt injection hardening
- Phase 2E: Oscillation detection, content limits, dialog handling
- Phase 3: Windows UI Automation via pywinauto — exact element coordinates from OS

**ARC-AGI-3: Complete Redesign**

- Daily lifecycle audit cron

**Bug Fixes**
- SQLCipher _DictRow compatibility (fixes all KeyError: 0 across codebase)
- 23 test failures + 48 errors resolved

### What's New in v0.68.0

**Document Powerhouse** — Cognithor can now create, read, and manage all major document formats:

- **7 document tools**: `read_pdf`, `read_docx`, `read_ppt`, `read_xlsx` (new), `document_export`, `document_create` (new), `typst_render` (new)
- **Template system**: `template_list` + `template_render` — fill Typst templates (Brief, Rechnung, Bericht) and compile to PDF
- **Structured creation**: JSON input with sections, tables, lists → DOCX, PDF, PPTX, XLSX
- **Typst pipeline**: modern LaTeX alternative for high-quality PDFs (<1s compilation)

**Skill Lifecycle** — Skills created by Cognithor are now immediately usable:

- Hot-loading: skills available instantly after creation (no restart)
- Startup scan of generated skills directory
- SkillLifecycleManager: audit, auto-repair, suggest, prune

**Tactical Memory (Tier 6)** — Tool outcome tracking across sessions:

- Learns which tools work best in which context
- Auto-creates avoidance rules after 3 consecutive failures (24h TTL)
- Injects tactical insights into Planner context

### What's New in v0.69.0

**Autonomous Thinking Loop (ATL)** — Cognithor now thinks proactively without user input:

- **GoalManager** — Structured YAML-persisted goals with progress tracking, priority, sub-goals, and success criteria. Migrates existing `learning_goals` automatically.
- **Thinking Cycles** — Every 5 minutes (configurable), the agent evaluates its goals, proposes and executes research actions, and writes a daily Markdown journal.
- **ActionQueue** — Priority-based action dispatch with blocked-type filtering. Actions routed through `search_and_read` with automatic parameter normalization.
- **Risk Ceiling** — Gatekeeper enforces per-context risk limits. ATL is capped at YELLOW (no destructive operations).
- **3 new MCP tools**: `atl_status`, `atl_goals`, `atl_journal`
- **Quiet Hours** — No autonomous thinking between 23:00-07:00 (configurable)

**CAPTCHA Solver** — Browser automation can now detect and solve CAPTCHAs:

- **7 types supported**: Text, reCAPTCHA v2 (checkbox + image grid), reCAPTCHA v3, hCaptcha, Cloudflare Turnstile, FunCaptcha
- **Vision-LLM solving** — Local models only (minicpm-v4.5 for simple, qwen3-vl:32b for complex). No external services.
- **Browser Stealth** — Anti-bot-detection: `navigator.webdriver=false`, realistic user-agent, plugin spoofing
- **Gatekeeper ORANGE** — Requires explicit user approval before solving
- **1 new MCP tool**: `browser_solve_captcha`

**AACS Phase 1 — Capability Tokens** — Cryptographic access control foundation:

- **Ed25519-signed tokens** — Unforgeable, short-lived (10s-1h), attenuation-only (child tokens can never exceed parent rights)
- **Token Issuer + Validator** — Full PGE delegation chain: Planner issues root → Gatekeeper delegates → Executor validates
- **Replay protection** — Nonce cache prevents token reuse
- **Revocation** — Instant token invalidation
- **Feature-flagged** — `log_only` mode for gradual rollout (Phases 2-6 coming)

**Dead Path Fixes** — Critical wiring issues found and fixed via deep audit:

- **SessionAnalyzer**: Improvements now applied automatically (was: proposed but discarded)
- **Hybrid Search**: Context Pipeline now uses BM25 + Vector + Graph search (was: BM25-only, ignoring 7000+ Knowledge Graph entities)
- **EpisodicCompressor**: Daily background task compresses episodes older than 30 days (was: never called)
- **Tactical Memory**: Now injected into Planner system prompt as "Taktische Einsichten" (was: populated but silently dropped)
- **PersonalityEngine.enhance_response()**: Method now exists (was: called but missing, failing silently)

**Production Fixes**:

- **VirtualLock elimination**: `SetProcessWorkingSetSize` expands Windows memory quota; `encrypted_connect()` respects `encryption_enabled` config
- **LLM Timeout**: 600s dynamic (was: 120s with artificial caps on embeddings)
- **PDF garbage entities**: Extended filter blocks XRef, Object/Root/Info IDs, font names, PDF structure markers
- **Corrupt sessions.db**: Graceful fallback when SQLCipher DB was encrypted with a different key

**126 new tests** (45 ATL + 45 CAPTCHA + 36 AACS), **125+ MCP tools** (was 122).

### What's New in v0.67.0

### v0.36.0-beta — 9 New Features: Roles, Delegation, Resume, Context Windows, Parallel Tools

- **Create / Operate / Live Role System** — Agents now have explicit roles: `orchestrator` (extended thinking, can spawn), `worker` (full MCP tool access), `monitor` (read-only). Default: `worker` for backward compat
- **Direction-based Delegation** — A2A messages gain a `direction` field: `remember` (memory-write), `act` (execute task), `notes` (fire-and-forget log). Role-based send permissions
- **Resume-as-Tool-Call** — Persistent checkpoints saved to disk (`~/.jarvis/checkpoints/`). Sessions can be resumed from last checkpoint via `cognithor_resume`
- **Per-Agent Context Windows** — Each agent owns an isolated `ContextWindow` with time-weighted trimming. System messages and tool results are never trimmed
- **Parallel Tool Calls** — Read-only MCP tools fire simultaneously via `asyncio.gather()`. Write tools remain sequential. Per-tool timeout (30s default)
- **Thinking / Execution Split** — Orchestrators think privately (Extended Thinking ON, not logged). Workers execute (logged). Cost tracking counts thinking tokens
- **Tab-as-Context-Window** — Browser tabs mapped to agent context via `TabContextBridge`. Tab state persists through checkpoints
- **Multi-Session Cognitive Base** — Persistent session management with cross-session Core Memory (max 2048 tokens, never auto-trimmed)
- **Priority-based Agent Scheduling** — Min-heap priority queue (1-10), 50/50 orchestrator/worker quota, platform-aware concurrency limits
- **Cross-platform Utilities** — `jarvis.utils.platform` module: `get_platform_name()`, `get_user_data_dir()`, `get_max_concurrent_agents()`, `supports_curses()`
- **11,769+ tests passing** (90 new feature tests + 10,814 existing, 0 regressions)

### v0.35.6-beta — Community-Reported Fixes (#26, #29, #33)

- **Search Button CSS Fix** — Global search trigger in legacy React Control Center was invisible (same background as header). Now uses `--bg3` for proper contrast in both light and dark themes (#26)
- **i18n Prompt Presets** — System prompts now load curated translations from `prompt_presets.py` (de/en/zh) instead of falling back to hardcoded German. Priority chain: Disk file -> i18n Preset -> Hardcoded (#33)
- **CORE.md Tool Deduplication** — Tool descriptions no longer dumped into CORE.md AND the Planner prompt. CORE.md now shows a one-line tool count reference; Planner gets localized, categorized descriptions via `ToolRegistryDB` (#29)
- **Prompt Evolution Guard** — Tool descriptions are now protected against mutation by the PromptEvolutionEngine. `locked` column on tools table + post-evolution validation rejects variants that remove `{tools_section}` (#29)
- **11,769+ tests passing** (0 failures)

### v0.34.4-beta — A2A Delegation, Sandbox Enforcement, Lint Zero

- **A2A Planner Delegation** — 2 new MCP tools (`list_remote_agents`, `delegate_to_remote_agent`) let the Planner autonomously discover and delegate tasks to remote A2A agents. Auto-discovery via `/.well-known/agent.json`
- **Sandbox Config Enforcement** — UI settings for `max_memory_mb`, `max_cpu_seconds`, and `network_access` now actually propagate to the execution sandbox (were previously ignored)
- **Proportional Iteration Caps** — `max_iterations` setting now scales coding task caps proportionally (80% for iteration cap, 30% for success threshold) instead of hardcoded limits
- **Auto-Update on Startup** — `plugins.auto_update` and `marketplace.auto_update` now trigger community registry sync at gateway startup
- **Lint Zero** — 393 lint errors (F401, F541, F841, E501, E741, E402) cleaned to zero across the entire codebase
- **MCP tools: 51 → 53** (added A2A delegation tools)
- **11,769+ tests passing** (0 failures)

### v0.34.3-beta — REPLAN Loop Fix, Full English UI, Tool Schemas

- **REPLAN Loop Fix** — Deep architectural fix to PGE loop: detects bare REPLAN text, consecutive no-tool iterations, and coding task caps to prevent infinite replanning
- **Full English UI** — All remaining German strings in legacy React Control Center translated (cron.js, A2A descriptions, icons, prompts)
- **Tool Schemas in CORE.md** — Auto-inventory now shows full parameter signatures (`tool(param: type *)`) instead of bare names
- **Chrome Autofill Defense** — GlobalSearch and provider filter inputs protected against Chrome autofill interference
- **Renamed "MCP & A2A" → "Integrations"** — Clearer page label in Command Center
- **Backend Startup Fix** — Vite now verifies jarvis importability before selecting a Python interpreter; bootstrap auto-repairs broken venvs

### v0.33.0-beta — i18n Language Packs, 4 Critical Bug Fixes

- **i18n Language Pack System** — JSON-based internationalization with dot-notation keys, SHA-256 integrity verification, fallback chain (locale → EN → raw key), thread-safe locale switching. Ships with German and English packs (~250 keys each)
- **Language Switcher in UI** — Command Center header quick-toggle (DE/EN) + General page dropdown. Language changes are live — no restart needed
- **Bug Fix: Planner JSON Parse Retry** — When the LLM returns malformed JSON, the planner now automatically retries with format hints instead of silently failing ("task failed successfully")
- **Bug Fix: LLM Timeout Wiring** — Embedding timeouts now respect the configured `timeout_seconds` instead of hardcoded values. LLM timeout is now visible on the Executor page for all backends
- **Bug Fix: WebSocket Race Condition** — All 12 `send_json()` calls in the WebSocket handler are now protected against disconnection errors via `_ws_safe_send()`. No more "Cannot call send" crashes
- **Bug Fix: GlobalSearch** — Added missing pages (Executor, Workflows, Knowledge Graph) to FIELD_INDEX and PAGE_LABELS. Search now finds all 19 config pages
- **11,769+ tests passing** (0 failures)

### v0.30.0 — mTLS, Document Reading, DB Retry

- **Document Reading** — 3 new MCP tools: `read_pdf` (PyMuPDF), `read_ppt` (python-pptx), `read_docx` (python-docx) with structured output, formatting, tables, images, metadata
- **mTLS for WebUI API** — Mutual TLS with auto-generated CA/server/client certificates; prevents unauthorized API access (`security.mtls.enabled`)
- **DB Retry Logic** — SQLite retries "database is locked" with exponential backoff + jitter (configurable)
- **MCP tools: 48 → 51**
