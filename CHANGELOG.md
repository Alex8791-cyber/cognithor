Versioning follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [0.22.0] – 2026-02-28

### Added
- **Control Center UI** — React 19 + Vite 7 dashboard integrated into repository (`ui/`)
- **Backend Launcher Plugin** — Vite plugin manages Python backend lifecycle (start/stop/orphan detection)
- **20+ REST API Endpoints** — Config CRUD, agents, bindings, prompts, cron jobs, MCP servers, A2A settings
- **55 UI API Integration Tests** — Full round-trip testing for every Control Center endpoint
- **Prompts Fallback** — Empty prompt files fall back to built-in Python constants
- **Health Endpoint** — `GET /api/v1/health` for backend liveness checks

### Fixed
- Agents GET returned hardcoded path instead of config's `jarvis_home`
- Bindings GET created ephemeral in-memory instances (always empty)
- MCP servers response format mismatch between backend and UI
- FastAPI route ordering: `/config/presets` captured by `/config/{section}`
- Prompts returned empty strings when 0-byte files existed on disk
- `policyYaml` round-trip stripped trailing whitespace

## [0.21.0] – 2026-02-27

- Removed manual `telegram_enabled`, `discord_enabled` etc. config flags
- All 10 channel types (Telegram, Discord, Slack, WhatsApp, Signal, Matrix, Teams, iMessage, IRC, Twitch) use token-based auto-detect

### Fixed
