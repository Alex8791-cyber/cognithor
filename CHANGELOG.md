Versioning follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [0.24.0] – 2026-03-01

### Added
- **Knowledge Synthesis** — Meta-analysis engine that orchestrates Memory, Vault, Web and LLM to build coherent understanding. 4 new MCP tools:
  - `knowledge_synthesize` — Full synthesis with confidence-rated findings (★★★), source comparison, contradiction detection, timeline, gap analysis
  - `knowledge_contradictions` — Compares stored knowledge (Memory + Vault) with current web information, identifies outdated facts and discrepancies
  - `knowledge_timeline` — Builds chronological timelines with causal chains (X → Y → Z) and trend analysis
  - `knowledge_gaps` — Completeness scoring (1–10), prioritized research suggestions with concrete search terms
- **Wissens-Synthese Skill** — New procedure (`data/procedures/wissens-synthese.md`) for guided knowledge synthesis workflow
- 3 depth levels: `quick` (Memory + Vault only), `standard` (+ 3 web results), `deep` (+ 5 web results, detailed analysis)
- Synthesis results can be saved directly to Knowledge Vault (`save_to_vault: true`)

### Changed
- tools.py captures return values from `register_web_tools` and `register_memory_tools` for dependency injection into synthesizer
- tools.py registers synthesis tools and wires LLM, Memory, Vault, and Web dependencies
- MCP Tool Layer expanded from 15+ to 18+ tools
- Version bumped to 0.24.0

## [0.23.0] – 2026-03-01

### Added
- **Knowledge Vault** — Obsidian-compatible Markdown vault (`~/.jarvis/vault/`) with YAML frontmatter, tags, `[[backlinks]]`, and full-text search. 6 new MCP tools: `vault_save`, `vault_search`, `vault_list`, `vault_read`, `vault_update`, `vault_link`
- **Document Analysis Pipeline** — LLM-powered structured analysis of PDF/DOCX/TXT/HTML documents via `analyze_document` tool. Analysis modes: full (6 sections), summary, risks, todos. Optional vault storage
- **Google Custom Search Engine** — 3rd search provider in the fallback chain (SearXNG → Brave → **Google CSE** → DuckDuckGo). Config: `google_cse_api_key`, `google_cse_cx`
- **Jina AI Reader Fallback** — Automatic fallback for JS-heavy sites where trafilatura extracts <200 chars. New `reader_mode` parameter (`auto`/`trafilatura`/`jina`) on `web_fetch`
- **Domain Filtering** — `domain_blocklist` and `domain_allowlist` in WebConfig for controlled web access
- **Source Cross-Check** — `cross_check` parameter on `search_and_read` appends a source comparison section
- **Dokument-Analyse Skill** — New procedure (`data/procedures/dokument-analyse.md`) for structured document analysis workflow
- **VaultConfig** — New Pydantic config model with `enabled`, `path`, `auto_save_research`, `default_folders`

### Changed
- Web search fallback chain now includes 4 providers (was 3)
- `web_fetch` uses auto reader mode with Jina fallback by default
- `search_and_read` supports optional source comparison
- MediaPipeline supports LLM and Vault injection for document analysis
- tools.py registers vault tools and wires LLM/vault into media pipeline
- Detailed German error messages when all search providers fail (instead of empty results)

## [0.22.0] – 2026-02-28

### Added
- **Control Center UI** — React 19 + Vite 7 dashboard integrated into repository (`ui/`)
- **Backend Launcher Plugin** — Vite plugin manages Python backend lifecycle (start/stop/orphan detection)
- **20+ REST API Endpoints** — Config CRUD, agents, bindings, prompts, cron jobs, MCP servers, A2A settings
- **55 UI API Integration Tests** — Full round-trip testing for every Control Center endpoint
- **Prompts Fallback** — Empty prompt files fall back to built-in Python constants
- **Health Endpoint** — `GET /api/v1/health` for backend liveness checks

### Fixed
- Agents GET returned hardcoded path instead of config's `jarvis_home`
- Bindings GET created ephemeral in-memory instances (always empty)
- MCP servers response format mismatch between backend and UI
- FastAPI route ordering: `/config/presets` captured by `/config/{section}`
- Prompts returned empty strings when 0-byte files existed on disk
- `policyYaml` round-trip stripped trailing whitespace

## [0.21.0] – 2026-02-27

### Added
- **Channel Auto-Detection** — Channels activate automatically when tokens are present in `.env`
- Removed manual `telegram_enabled`, `discord_enabled` etc. config flags
- All 10 channel types (Telegram, Discord, Slack, WhatsApp, Signal, Matrix, Teams, iMessage, IRC, Twitch) use token-based auto-detect

### Fixed
- Telegram not receiving messages when started via Control Center UI
- Config flag `telegram_enabled: false` blocked channel registration even when token was set

### Fixed
- JSON parse failures in planner responses
- Cross-request context loss for vision and tool results
- Telegram photo analysis path and intent forwarding
- Whisper voice transcription CPU mode enforcement
- Telegram approval deadlock for web tool classifications
